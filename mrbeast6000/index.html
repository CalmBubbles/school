I love MrBeast, because of their content and personality. Jimmy's content is always entertaining yet still helpful and influences people in a good way. Jimmy always puts their heart to whatever they are making. He loves making people smile. He gives away money because it makes him happy. He is rich and poor at the same time. Every month he gets a revenue of $2 million from making content, but most of it goes to charity and content creation. Jimmy is a kind and selfless person. Jimmy has determination, patience and perseverance. He wanted to work as a content creator ever since he was 13. He failed many times, but he never gave up and never let himself down. It took him most of his teenage life, but he waited with action and got to his goal. Jimmy is an inspiration for a lot of people, including me.

We are similar in some ways
